# MACHINE LEARNING COURSE BASED PROJECT

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook used for a Machine Learning Course-Based Project (CBP). The project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow using real-world datasets, covering steps such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Overview

The notebook walks through: <br/>
  &emsp;-> Loading and exploring datasets<br/>
  &emsp;-> Data preprocessing and feature selection <br/>
  &emsp;-> Training various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) <br/>
  &emsp;-> Evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc. <br/>
  &emsp;-> Visualizing results using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` <br/>
This project is useful for students or beginners looking to understand end-to-end ML workflows.

## Requirements

You can run this notebook directly in Google Colab, which already has most dependencies pre-installed. <br/>

If running locally: <br/>
  &emsp;-> Python 3.7+ <br/>
  &emsp;-> Required libraries: <br/>
      &emsp;&emsp;-> pandas <br/>
      &emsp;&emsp;-> numpy <br/>
      &emsp;&emsp;-> scikit-learn <br/>
      &emsp;&emsp;-> matplotlib <br/>
      &emsp;&emsp;-> seaborn <br/>

Install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can create a `requirements.txt` using:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

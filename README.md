# MACHINE LEARNING COURSE BASED PROJECT

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook used for a Machine Learning Course-Based Project (CBP). The project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow using real-world datasets, covering steps such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Overview

The notebook walks through:
  -> Loading and exploring datasets  
  -> Data preprocessing and feature selection
  -> Training various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
  -> Evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.
  -> Visualizing results using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
This project is useful for students or beginners looking to understand end-to-end ML workflows.

##Repository Structure
```bash
ML-CBP/
├── ML_CBP_Notebook.ipynb       # Main Google Colab notebook
├── README.md                   # Project description and usage guide
└── datasets/                   # (Optional) Directory to store local datasets
```

##Requirements

You can run this notebook directly in Google Colab, which already has most dependencies pre-installed.

If running locally:
  -> Python 3.7+
  -> Required libraries:
      -> pandas
      -> numpy
      -> scikit-learn
      -> matplotlib
      -> seaborn

Install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can create a `requirements.txt` using:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
